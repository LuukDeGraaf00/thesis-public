    abstract    = {From the PrefaceApplied mathematics is largely concerned with the design and analysis of explicit procedures for calculating the exact or approximate values of various functions. Such explicit procedures are called algorithms or programs. Because an effective notation for the description of programs exhibits considerable syntactic structure, it is called a programming language.Much of applied mathematics, particularly the more recent computer-related areas which cut across the older disciplines, suffers from the lack of an adequate programming language. It is the central thesis of this book that the descriptive and analytic power of an adequate programming language amply repays the considerable effort required for its mastery. This thesis is developed by first presenting the entire language and then applying it in later chapters to several major topics.The areas of application are chosen primarily for their intrinsic interest and lack of previous treatment, but they are also designed to illustrate the universality and other facets of the language. For example, the microprogramming of Chapter 2 illustrates the divisibility of the language, i.e., the ability to treat a restricted area using only a small portion of the complete language. Chapter 6 (Sorting) shows its capacity to compass a relatively complex and detailed topic in a short space. Chapter 7 (The Logical Calculus) emphasizes the formal manipulability of the language and its utility in theoretical work.The material was developed largely in a graduate course given for several years at Harvard and in a later course presented repeatedly at the IBM Systems Research Institute in New York. It should prove suitable for a two-semester course at the senior or graduate level. Although for certain audiences an initial presentation of the entire language may be appropriate, I have found it helpful to motivate the development by presenting the minimum notation required for a given topic, proceeding to its treatment (e.g., microprogramming), and then returning to further notation. The 130-odd problems not only provide the necessary finger exercises but also develop results of general interest.Chapter 1 or some part of it is prerequisite to each of the remaining "applications" chapters, but the applications chapters are virtually independent of one another. A complete appreciation of search techniques (Chapter 4) does, however, require a knowledge of methods of representation (Chapter 3). The cross references which do occur in the applications chapters are either nonessential or are specific to a given figure, table, or program. The entire language presented in Chapter 1 is summarized for reference at the end of the book.}

We present a novel technique, embedded pattern matching, which enables a natural and user friendly embedding of user defined algebraic data types into the embedded language, and allows programmers to pattern match on terms in the embedded language in much the same way they would in the host language.},

Operations on disjoint vector elements are not supported directly and require explicit data reorganization manipulations. Computations on non-contiguous and especially interleaved data appear in important applications, which can greatly benefit from SIMD instructions once the data is reorganized properly. Vectorizing such computations efficiently is therefore an ambitious challenge for both programmers and vectorizing compilers. We demonstrate an automatic compilation scheme that supports effective vectorization in the presence of interleaved data with constant strides that are powers of 2, facilitating data reorganization. We demonstrate how our vectorization scheme applies to dominant SIMD architectures, and present experimental results on a wide range of key kernels, showing speedups in execution time up to 3.7 for interleaving levels (stride) as high as 8.},

It turns out that this idea directly supports a powerful form of abstraction called associated types, which are available in C++ using traits classes. Associated types are useful in many applications, especially for self-optimising libraries that adapt their data representations and algorithms in a type-directed manner.In this paper, we introduce and motivate associated types as a rather natural generalisation of Haskell's existing type classes. Formally, we present a type system that includes a type-directed translation into an explicitly typed target language akin to System F; the existence of this translation ensures that the addition of associated data types to an existing Haskell compiler only requires changes to the front end.},

It has been around for more than 10 years, and a lot of progress has been made, in particular in the lazy functional programming language Haskell. There are morethan 10 proposals for generic programming libraries orlanguage extensions for Haskell. To compare and characterise the many generic programming libraries in atyped functional language, we introduce a set of criteria and develop a generic programming benchmark: a set of characteristic examples testing various facets of datatype-generic programming. We have implemented the benchmark for nine existing Haskell generic programming libraries and present the evaluation of the libraries. The comparison is useful for reaching a common standard for generic programming, but also for a programmer who has to choose a particular approach for datatype-generic programming.},

    abstract = {We present a technique to combine deep and shallow embedding in the context of compiling embedded languages in order to provide the benefits of both techniques. When compiling embedded languages it is natural to use an abstract syntax tree to represent programs. This is known as a deep embedding and it is a rather cumbersome technique compared to other forms of embedding, typically leading to more code and being harder to extend. In shallow embeddings, language constructs are mapped directly to their semantics which yields more flexible and succinct implementations. But shallow embeddings are not well-suited for compiling embedded languages. Our technique uses a combination of deep and shallow embedding, which helps keeping the deep embedding small and makes extending the embedded language much easier. The technique also has some unexpected but welcome secondary effects. It provides fusion of functions to remove intermediate results for free without any additional effort. It also helps us to give the embedded language a more natural programming interface.}

    abstract="Generic programming aims to increase the flexibility of programming languages, by expanding the possibilities for parametrizationÂ --- ideally, without also expanding the possibilities for uncaught errors. The term means different things to different people: parametric polymorphism, data abstraction, meta-programming, and so on. We use it to mean polytypism, that is, parametrization by the shape of data structures rather than their contents. To avoid confusion with other uses, we have coined the qualified term datatype-generic programming for this purpose. In these lecture notes, we expand on the definition of datatype-generic programming, and present some examples of datatype-generic programs. We also explore the connection with design patterns in object-oriented programming; in particular, we argue that certain design patterns are just higher-order datatype-generic programs.",
